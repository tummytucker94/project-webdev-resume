How
In order to complete this assignment, I researched the basic format of a web developer's resume and coded them into Codepen's text editor. I like using Codepen because it has separate text editors that allow you to organize your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, and also because it has a visual interface that allows you to see how your code will look. Afterwards, I saved the code in Github in order to become more familiar with using GitHub--still learning by the way.
